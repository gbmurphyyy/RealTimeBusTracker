# Real Time Bus Tracker #

## Description of Project ##
_[How To Run]_

The objective of this exercise was to create a button and display the live locations of the MBTA bus route betweeen the campuses of MIT and Harvard. The button created is labeled "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard". Once the button is clicked, the marker on the map pinpoints each bus stop along the route. Every time the page is refreshed, the map displays real-time data of the bus location. This was accomplished by using a token key (received from https://www.mapbox.com) and replacing "YOUR_KEY" in the "MapAnimation.js" file.
